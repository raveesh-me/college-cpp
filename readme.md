# Object Oriented Programming with C++ Lab
This repository is my revision of object oriented programming taught at my college, strictly used to pass the exam.
The code within this repository  **DOES NOT** represent the extent of my actual skills.
There may be coding mistakes that we are expected to make by the instructor, so please use this material for exam purpose only,
and don't judge my capability by the code within this repository;

## Day 01
Abstraction

lab01.cpp
About objects and abstraction. A class declaration helps with the abstraction of properties and we are able to create a blueprint of a 
Student that contains the given data members and also has methods to serve

lab01_structure.cpp
Abstraction can alse be attained by the use of structures, which are contructs available both in C and C++

## Day 02
Encapsulation

lab02.cpp
It shows how we can encpsulate the vital data member of our class. 
`speed` and `checkSpeed()` being private data and function members,
we have used them in our public properties/methods which we expose to the rest of our code. Namely:

`printSpeed()`
`carStart()`
`carFast()`
`carSlow()`

These public methods are called from main that gives us access to the functionality of the class

lab02_interaction.cpp
